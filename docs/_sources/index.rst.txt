Welcome to Probabilistic Linear Regression's documentation!
===========================================================

This is a library for fitting of probabilistic General Linear Model for solving 
regression problems.

It facilitates the needs of fitting, diagnostifying, and persisting of
probabilistic GLMs for solving regression tasks.

Main functionality is available through ProabilisticGLM class. Further
details are available in the documentation.

A video of the fitting process is available below.
