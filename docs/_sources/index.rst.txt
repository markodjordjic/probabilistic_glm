Probabilistic GLM for Solving Regression Problems
=================================================

This is a library for fitting of probabilistic General Linear Model for
solving regression problems.

It facilitates the needs of fitting, diagnostifying, and persisting of
probabilistic GLMs for solving regression tasks.

Main functionality is available through ProabilisticGLM class. Further
details are available in the documentation.
